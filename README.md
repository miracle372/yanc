# yanc
```yanc``` is yet another neofetch clone for *nix systems. It is VERY work in project and should not be used outside of development use.

## Why?
Just for fun! This is by no means a serious project and things like performance are not a priority, so don't use ```yanc``` if that's what you're looking for.

## Compiling
```
meson setup builddir
meson compile -C builddir
```
